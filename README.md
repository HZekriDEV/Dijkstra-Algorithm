# Dijkstra's Algorithm
This program allows you to build a mathematical graph structure and compute the shortest path between two vertices using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. Furthermore, the program displays the graph's adjacency matrix representation to allow you to get a sense of what the abstract graph looks like.

To run the program, download or clone this repository and run "Dijkstra's Algorithm.exe" in the "Release" folder.
